\item{from}{Raster* The sources raster to be resampled.}

\item{to}{Raster* A target raster that the from will be resampled to (extent, resolution, projection).}

\item{method}{Character. Default is "mode". See details.}

\description{
Performs an area-weighted resampling of raster datasets.
}
\details{
This function is designed to solve the problem of resampling/reprojecting rasters
using area-based, not point based (e.g. nearest neighbor, bilinear, cubic convolution), 
resampling.  The output pixel is a function of the areas of the input pixels, so this
should be used for resampling from a finer resolution to a coarser resolution.

The method defaults to "mode", which will return the value covering the largest area
of the output pixel area.  Other methods will be added in the future.

A word of warning: this algorithm is SLOW.  The function uses focal_hpc, so we 
highly recommend using it with a foreach engine running (e.g. use sfQuickInit() ).
Keep in mind this is a "dirty" parallel problem, so different chunks may execute at
different speeds and have different memory footprints.
